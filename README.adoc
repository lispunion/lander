= Lander

Lander generates a complete Ansible configuration from a Lisp form.
How you obtain the Lisp form is up to you. You can write it by hand or
use your favorite Lisp dialect to generate it.

The name was inspired by space exploration and Lisp's mascot, the
alien. Ansible generates scripts and lands them on foreign hosts;
Lander lets us do it in Lisp.

The file `hello.lisp` contains a Hello World configuration that
creates a text file in `/tmp` on localhost. Run `hello.sh` to try it.
